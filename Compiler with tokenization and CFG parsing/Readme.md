A context-free grammar is defined using a dictionary named grammar. This grammar appears to be for a language that includes statements, conditions, and expressions.
The cykCheck function implements the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) parsing algorithm to check if a given sequence of tokens conforms to the specified grammar.
The CYK parsing algorithm is applied to determine if the input source code follows the defined grammar rules.
The checkGrammar function is responsible for preparing tokens for CYK parsing by mapping specific tokens like "if" and "else" to their corresponding grammar symbols.
It then calls cykCheck with the prepared tokens to check if the source code conforms to the defined grammar.
In the __main__ block, the code takes user input as the source code to be checked.
It tokenizes the input source code and prepares the tokens for grammar validation.
It calls cykCheck to determine if the source code follows the defined grammar.
If the code is accepted by the grammar, it prints the token type and value of each token.
If there is a syntax error, it prints "Syntax Error: Invalid statement."
